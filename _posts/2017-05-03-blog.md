title: Blog Revival
---

For the last few years I was doing alot of more or less interesting projects (at least interesting for me at the time) but never got the chance to talk about them.

I always had this problem with releasing and talking about stuff, for example [Deci3dbg - Ida Pro Debugger Module for Playstation 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/2014/05/30/deci3dbg/) was released in May of 2014, but actually it was not touched by me since 2013.

My personal promise to myself is try to fix this.

Right now my plan is to revisit my personal old projects and write about them.

Also I release first bunch of articles that already have been written long time ago.

- [Advanced Ida Pro Instruction Highlighting]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/05/03/ida_coloring/)
- [Taiko no Tatsujin DS Custom Songs]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/05/03/taiko/)
- [Reverse Engeneering of Xbox Security Method 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/05/03/xsm3/)

Also blog style has been updated. I got the feeling how its should look like while was reading two of my favorite blogs. Jekyll template is mine, but style mostly inspired and based on work of Freddy Leitner with his permission.
